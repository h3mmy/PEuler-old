label -> name
:: type
col -> group

row -> ring -> field

grid -> vector space (affine?)

Ex:

date::timestamp  event::stringlabel assoc::stringname
12031991         bday               zak
06041776         cday               us
08141947         iday               pk

Inferring timestamp:-

8-digit number. 
Leading zeroes if necessary.

combination operator possible... can form arbitrary group S3 OR maintain that there is a combination operator without closure.
Defines computational boundedness

cols only related by type
rows linking data together. For n rows, form Kn for complete association. If categorization of labels reduction to m datapoints, then Km for coagulation where m < n.
